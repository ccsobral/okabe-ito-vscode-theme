# okabe-ito-vscode-theme
A VSCode dark theme, based on a colourblind-friendly palette by Masataka Okabe and Kei Ito.

The motivation for creating this theme came about because:
1. I could not find a very-dark theme that I had no reservations about
2. I had just come across this idea of Color Universal Design and the lovely colour palette designed by Okabe and Ito to be as universal as possible.

__small disclaimer__: I'm not colourblind in any way, so I'm not actually sure of the effectiveness of this theme.
If you have found it (not) useful, do let me know!
